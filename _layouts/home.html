                <p>I hope that this site has helped inform you on how Contemporary Media Literacy 
                    can help Open Data achieve it's goal of helping society. I have presented what 
                    Critical Media Literacy entails. How it's use encourages under-estimated groups 
                    to particiapte and succeed in society. I have shown that Open Data has failed 
                    to achieve it's goal of improving citizen's understanding and participation in society.
                    Finally, I have demonstrated through demonstration and dialog how the use of Contemporary 
                    Media Literacy will improve the outcomes of Open Data and achieve it's goals.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    If you would like to learn more how to use Contemporary Media Literacy to to improve 
                    Open Data either as an advocate or professional, pelase add your name to this site and 
                    join the movement.
