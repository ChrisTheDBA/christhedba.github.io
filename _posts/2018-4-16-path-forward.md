<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When the term “Open Data” was first used, it promised to offer economic growth and broad-based social value as well as transparency and accountability for government. The promised social value of Open Data has not been widely realized. Going forward Open Data needs to be implemented as a Contemporary Media Literacy to achieve broad social value. Contemporary Media Literacy is a group of practices that allow individuals to access, analyze, create, and evaluate all forms of communication critically. Contemporary Media Literacy is a natural response given the changing nature of society to a complex, ever changed electronic environment. In this essay, I will demonstrate that Open Data needs to employ the practices of Media Literacy to achieve the promise of social change.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<div class="row">
    <div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        Data are becoming a dominant code describing a society. Companies like Yelp and Zillow use Open Data to inform and influence decisions. (Govlab) In these situations, the companies use open, public data to run their businesses and make a profit. These companies have enormous resources and expertise that they can deploy to acquire, transform and use Open Data. Political campaigns are using data to target voters and sway their votes. (Halpern, 2018) Ordinary people are not on equal footing. People are barraged with misleading information and misinformation. This affects buying patterns, political agendas, and elections and every other aspect of people’s lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        In response, government agencies ranging from the local to the federal level have shared data through Open Data Portals. These Open Data portals are web-based platforms created to make it easier to find information. They act like library catalogs, containing records of datasets published for reuse. Most of the data are in the form of raw, numerical data. These structures are combined with a search functionality. Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are also often available. This offers direct and automated access to data for software applications. However, all these formats require special knowledge and tools to make the information useful.
    </div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        Since 2009, the use of Open Data portals has promised several democratic reforms and championed by governments, such as the Obama administration: “We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government.” (Obama, 2013) The memorandum goes to cite transparency, participation, and collaboration as three desired goals. However, we have failed to see those goals realized. Useful, meaningful data are not released, most people simply do not have the skills, tools or time to use available data and there is little work being done to allow for collaboration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Open Data has become the de facto domain of the well-educated technologist and out of the reach of the average person. In Literacy Theories for the Digital Age, Kathy Mills states that literacy is based on ideology, and must be examined about society’s social frameworks and power interactions. (2015) Mills goes on to say that it is “a form of cultural capital that is distributed in selective and uneven ways to different groups.” (44) In this context, the technologists building and using these Open Data sites structure them in terms to optimize their abilities and expertise.  Using Open Data sites requires either GIS (Geographic Information Systems) or spreadsheet skills like Microsoft Excel. Whether it is intentional or behavioral, Open Data practitioners appear not to understand that not everyone has the same skills as themselves.

<h3>The Status Quo</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        Many believe that the role of Open Data is simply to provide transparency and accountability without regard to who can use and interpret the data. If this is the case, Open Data has met the obligations set forth. (Carolan, 2016) The majority of Open Data portals do accountability and transparency well, but few consider making them accessible to citizens without special skills. (Mayerkik, 2017) The focus of these sites is to make the data accessible to academics, organizations, and institutions and with little or no regard to the communities that the government entity serves. 
    </div>
    <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        This simple practice of transparency is not enough. The people who are most affected by the data must be included in all discussions regarding the data and solutions arrived at because of the data. An example from a conference I attended some years ago shows that transparency for its own sake leads to more problems than it solves. (O’Reilly, 2010) In the talk, Danah Boyd uses the example of the sex offender registry. The release of the data, required by law, and posting on-line meet the requirements of transparency and accountability. Without the context of critical literacy, people constantly misinterpret why people are on the list and end up needlessly stigmatizing people years later.

<h3>Increase Data Literacy</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        Many Open Data programs are addressing the issue of “data privilege” by convening academies. In Los Angeles, for instance, they have a summer internship called the Mayor’s Data Academy. (DataLA) This program requires a summer-long commitment as well as strong analytical, research, writing, verbal, and interpersonal skills. The mayor’s strategy is to make data accessible to all, but through these criteria maintain the social castes that already exist. The people getting access are similar to people with access already.
        <br>
        <br>
        In another program which does a better job working with ordinary citizens, the city of Buffalo has a program called Data 101. (Crowe,2019) The city developed this program an evolution to a previous Citizen Participation Academy which designed to give everyday citizens working knowledge of their local government. The program lead states that attendees of various ethnicities, ranging in age, and location across the city are signing up for the program. The participants learn how the data impacts them whether the focus is parking capacity, housing development or food resources. The program hopes that in the next few years, citizens can have more informed dialogues and will lead to more effective decision making from all levels in the city.
    </div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        The two approaches show how the introduction of media literacy into an Open Data program improves the outcomes of the program. By making ordinary citizens more literate regarding data, Buffalo achieves the goals of participation with and collaboration with government.  Because of the acquired media literacy, civic engagement is increased.
        <br>
        <br>
        As further evidence that media literacy encourages civic engagement, we can examine a recent study of high school students. The study shows that media literacy improves the level of civic engagement. (Martens & Hobbs, 2013) In this study, they found that the ability to analyze information was improved when the students participated in literacy programs where the key focus was a critical evaluation of the presented examples involving data. In contrast, students without the additional training did not perform as well when their analysis was based purely on their commonplace experience of media and information. Innovative, pedagogical methods described above provide a means for people without specialized skills to exert more control over their interactions with society. The agency provided by this training will enable more communication of ideas and elevate civic engagement.

<h3>Multimodal Communication</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        In addition to creating a more literate population, governments need to alter the ways that Open Data is delivered to citizens. In general, Open Data portals provide data without context or meaning. This practice works well for sophisticated users, but ordinary people will quickly lose interest. In response, effective Open Data sites present stories to make the data come alive.
        <br>
        <br>
        Open Data sites that offer interaction deliver more value to people without specialized skills. For instance, the state of Ohio has an interactive budget site that allows people to focus on the information important to them. Enormous amounts of data are presented in easy to read graphs. These graphs rely on the fact that our eyes detect visual elements such as size, shape, and contrast. (PolicyViz, 2018) In Pittsburgh, PA, the city at the urging of neighborhood groups concerned with gang violence built a website called Burgh’s Eye View. The site provides an interactive map where people can plot police activity, fire activity, and traffic accidents among others. (Raths, 2017)
    </div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        This interactivity presents the data in a multimodal fashion. Multimodal delivery of data is imperative to bridging Open Data and critical literacy. This visual rhetoric uses layout, font, color and imagery to add to a rhetorical message delivered by the data alone. Data without these elements is the traditional mode of conveying information. With the addition of color and form, we enter multimodal forms of literacy. The information is presented in a way that is easier for people to understand.
        <br>
        <br>
        An even more effective method of storytelling with data is the narrative map. A narrative map tells a story through space and time. The narrative map can plot images over time to tell the story of the growth or decline of a neighborhood or city. By using multimedia (videos, images, sound, and text), a narrative map can tell the story of a major issue such as racial inequity in Asheville, NC. (City of Asheville GIS) The focus is on storytelling, and not the display of massive amounts of data.
    </div>

<br>
<h3>Critical Thinking:The Lynchpin</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
        Without critical thinking, the acquired skills of creating multimodal, useful data and “reading” data through interactive visualizations and narrative mapping will remain ineffective. Today, the use of data to influence our behaviors and opinions is widespread. Underlying this is the belief that those with power can better control people because they cannot see through the obfuscations and outright lies they are subjected to daily. Critical thinking is the skill to allow individuals to examine their society, place within it, and challenge that place if necessary.
    </div>
    <div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
        A critically illiterate population will believe the media, for example, that racial inequity is disappearing, Consider these statistics. Median black income is 67 percent of median white income, (US Census Bureau, 2018) and the official black youth unemployment was 7.3 percent in 2018 compared to 3.9 percent for white youth, (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). Traditional thinking provides no real-life data and carries the hidden message that learning critical thinking has nothing to do with learning to understand and control the world.

<h3>The Path Forward</h3>
<p>
        Data alone does not empower people. To take advantage of Open Data, people need critical literacy which includes the skills to understand, interpret and create data in context. If we desire this Open Data because we want a better-informed citizenry and a fairer society, we must start by embracing the importance of media literacy and the need to provide infrastructure to help people build the skills necessary to create, read and understand the data. The path forward for Open Data is media literacy. Because when empowered, people improve decision making for themselves, advance their communities, and expand the opportunities afforded them. That is ultimately the role of government, Open Data, and critical media literacy.
