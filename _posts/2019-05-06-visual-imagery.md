<h3><span><b>
Engaged Students Learn Data Skills
</b></span></h3>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/assets/images/students-learning.jpg" alt="" /></span>
This image shows students engaged learning and using a computer. Gender and racial differences are no relevant. The students are engaged and learning on their own.  It does not appear they are following a prescribe path and are learning at their own pace and in their own style.

I picked this image because I wanted to convey the idea of engaged students. This photo clearly shows this. The students are leaning in, smiling and pointing. In short, they are having good time learning. They are engaged. I chose a diverse group of students because I wanted to show that this model of literacy allows for some of domination and privilege present in traditional literacy.

This image comes from the website of Wired Magazine. Wired has been published since 1993 and takes a forward looking and innovative approach to the use and influence of technology. It is sometime referred as “the Rolling Stone of technology”. Since I am approaching this from a standpoint of technology allows for improved and relevant literacy.

Reflection Questions
</b></span></p>

<p><span>
My goal was to show engaged students and spent quite some time looking over images to find one that conveys my intent. I was a little surprised that I could not locate a photo of adults engaged in a similar way. I might have chosen an image of adults or adults and children to represent an even more diversity.

The image allows more information about the idea to be transmitted than the words alone. It allows for body language and context information to be transmitted. This allows to the viewers own experiences to influence their interpretation of the image.
