<p><span class="image circle right"><img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi my name is Chris and I’m a transfer student with a Business Analytics,Marketing and Engineering degrees. I’m (mumble, mumble) years old and coming back to school for a lateral move in my career from Database Administration to Data Science. In fact, two years ago I changed jobs and now run the Data Analytics program for the Wake County government.</p>
<p>
Previously, I was the Senior DBA and Open Data Engineer for Wake County. I have spent the last 20 plus years in IT, a computer engineer before that and an Electrical Engineer before that. In my current job, I manage the data analysts in the various departments and deriving actionable information from the vast amounts of data the county collects and generates. </p>
<p>
I love giving back to the community and helping others and have found "my tribe" in the civic hacking community here in the Triangle. I co-chair a series of local events called NC OpenPass. We bring together government, business, neighborhood, non-profit, and academic communities to work toward next generation solutions for local municipalities.</p>
<p>
I also volunteer with other groups such as Code for Raleigh, RTP Analysts, NC Datapalooza, NCData4Good and Triangle Open Data Day. I have presented findings for my work at Wake County and have been a speaker at various conferences on Open Data as well.</p>
